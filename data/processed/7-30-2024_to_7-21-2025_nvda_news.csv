2024-07-31 15:23:00,Mag 7 growth prospects becoming 'very hard to hit',"A clear narrative is emerging in equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) as the tech sector (XLK) undergoes a rotation, with Big Tech earnings failing to impress investors despite high valuations. Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a ""rotation narrative"" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it ""very hard to hit"" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. ""Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,"" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, ""all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.""

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: ""I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has ""at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this. And all of this is goodness for Nvidia.""

Zino observes that the chip space is undergoing its own rotation out of semiconductor and AI names, mirroring the broader tech market rotation. However, with AMD's earnings beat, he notes that fears about the sustainability of this momentum or the materialization of revenue from AI investments ""is starting to ease."" With Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings results still some time away, questions are rising about whether the chip sector can maintain its momentum. Zino points out that catalysts can come not only from chip earnings but also from tech earnings and even analog plays like Texas Instruments (TXN). Nevertheless, he tells Yahoo Finance: ""We think Nvidia's gonna post some great results. We think that's gonna be a catalyst for the space.""

In a note, Barclays Head of US Equity Strategy Venu Krishna wrote that tech leaders are in ""the penalty box"" at this time. Krishna joins the Catalyst team in-studio to talk about the refocus on AI monetization while tech stocks are trading increasingly higher than their earnings. ""If you look at Meta (META), they posted very good numbers on digital ads. If you look at Amazon (AMZN), they posted very good numbers on their AWS side. And so if you look at individual names, they are checking the box,"" Krishna tells Yahoo Finance. ""But clearly as the focus changes on onto the monetization of AI, from here on you don't want to pay very high multiples and you want to see actually the monetization showing up in earnings. And clearly this is a secular trend..."" Krishna goes on to give his year-end forecast for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and communicate how he sees the rest of the market (^DJI, ^IXIC) reacting to third quarter earnings forecasts.

Moorhead believes he sees: ""Three major buckets for AI plays."" ""The first one is this infrastructure. Anybody who is related to building out these massive, data centers with GPUs in them... I'm very confident next 12 to 18 months, that's going to be the case. And we saw the capital expenditure commitments by Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN). It is absolutely pedal to the metal on that."" He continues with: ""The enterprise software providers, that there has to be benefit in a large scale for all this to interconnect because there is just factually an over-investment in the capability versus the downstream benefits at this point.""

2024-08-08 21:25:00,"The US economy is slowing, not collapsing: Raymond James CIO","It's been a rollercoaster ride on Wall Street this week. The major stock market indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) closed in positive territory on Thursday after being hit by a three-day sell-off at the beginning of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 680 points while the S&P 500 had its best trading day since January 2023. Raymond James CIO Larry Adam joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the market action and how investors can navigate the pullback. ""What happened over last Friday and then Monday, I think everybody got a little bit premature thinking that this economy was going to roll over into a recession, that the Fed was going to have these emergency cuts, and the reality is that the economy is slowing, but it's not collapsing,"" Adam says of the sell-off. He believes that while the economy will continue to slow, there will not be a recession when the Federal Reserves begins cutting rates. ""I think we've learned over time that the market loves these narratives and you get to see these more extreme moves,"" he adds, thus fundamentals and earnings are more reliable metrics moving forward. As the tech sector (XLK) took a beating this week, Adam believes that Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings will provide key insight into the sustainability of the AI race. ""Our base case is that the AI theme is still very early stages and that it will continue to drive the tech sector for the foreseeable future,"" he explains. He notes that in Wednesday's trading session, mega-cap tech stocks went into oversold conditions, so investors could use dips as good buying opportunities.

2024-08-08 17:54:46,Navigating sell-offs and a volatile market: Catalysts,"On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills provide key insight into the market volatility and how investors can best navigate it. The number of initial jobless claims filed for the week ending in August 3 fell to 233,000, coming in below the expected 240,000. The cooler-than-expected data is a sign of relief for investors after July's jobs report stoked recession fears and kicked off a three-day global market sell-off. Glenmede Chief of Investment Strategy and Research Jason Pride explains, ""We had a little bit of an economic surprise that people are still, I think, deciphering that employment report. I mean, even today with the jobless claims numbers, people are kind of looking back and questioning, well, how do you reconcile these two?"" Pride explains. Nvidia (NVDA) has fallen from its heights in June as the overall tech sector took a hit in the recent market sell-off. New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban believes that despite concerns around the macro-environment and a potential Blackwell delay, he still expects Nvidia to ""remain dominate in a market that is growing very, very fast."" He adds, ""I think that for 2025... things are fairly well set. You can look at things from multiple angles. We talked about the hyperscalers' cap-ex earlier. We know roughly how much they expect to grow cap-ex. Plans are already set. They already have a plan to train the next generation of the GPT models and the next generation of Gemini models. I think here there's probably limited room for much changes in plans."" Barclays has downgraded the retail sector to Neutral, explaining that promotions suggest ""weakening demand."" Barclays consumer discretionary senior analyst Adrienne Yih explains the reasoning behind the move, saying, ""Last year, it was all about cleaning up the inventory. And so there were a ton of promotions last year, and rightfully so because these companies are trying to get rid of that inventory. We are seeing the same level of promoting now that the companies have clean inventory. So what that basically means is they're doing it for an entirely different reason,"" Yih explains. ""They're doing it to drive and stimulate traffic and conversion. And that's clearly an indication that the consumer is very choiceful and pulling back."" The volatility index (^VIX) has made major moves this week, spiking on Monday amid a large global sell-off. Ballast Rock Private Wealth senior wealth advisor and portfolio manager Jim Carroll argues, ""Volatility does create opportunity because if you like the S&P at its July 16th high, then why wouldn't you like it better where it is now? And I think it goes to the timeframe. If you have patience, if you're a long-term investor and if you are blessed to have cash to put to work in an environment like this, these can be seen as opportunities to put some of that money to work for the long run.""

Looking forward, chip stocks look to regain momentum after August volatility, but can they capture their previous heights? KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to give insight into the chip sector and how semiconductor stocks may perform as Big Tech leans harder into AI. ""I think if you look at the sell-off over the last several weeks related to the chip sector, maybe more specifically to Nvidia, I think one, you had some concerns about maybe hyper scaler CapEx [capital expenditures] getting to kind of peak levels, but I think those were largely addressed later when you had comments coming out from Microsoft (MSFT) that it's still seeing phenomenal demand on the AI front, and it's actually supply-constrained,"" Vinh says. ""The second factor is there's some concerns out there that its next-generation Blackwell product could be delayed. I wouldn't find that too surprising."" In terms of how the stock may perform, Vinh believes Nvidia will ""beat and raise, we don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.""

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

This comes as Huawei Technologies is reportedly close to introducing a new AI chip that could rival Nvidia's place in the Chinese market. Author of ""Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology"" Chris Miller joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the Huawei news and the future of US-China relations. ""We shouldn't be surprised that Huawei is trying to build newer and better chips, given that the Chinese government has anointed Huawei as the country's chip champion and given all the resources that it needs to try to catch up to Western leaders in chip production like Nvidia,"" Miller explains. As the 2024 presidential election nears, all eyes are on Vice President Kamala Harris's position on China. He notes that both President Biden and former President Trump have taken relatively similar stances on China and its chips. He adds, ""I don't think it's likely that Harris would meaningfully shift from any of those positions, whether it's about subsidizing domestic manufacturing or trying to limit technology transfer to China. Both of those policies have bipartisan support, and they've persisted across multiple administrations.""

Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the tech industry sa recession fears circulate. If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

The Futurum Group chief market strategist Cory Johnson joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the implications of this acquisition for AMD's future. Johnson notes that this deal positions AMD as ""a more complete offering"" among its competitors, particularly Nvidia (NVDA). He points out that Nvidia's systems are ""complete,"" with the company managing operations well beyond just chip sales. The ZT acquisition ""gives AMD something closer"" to achieving this level of control, though Johnson acknowledges there's still a considerable gap to close. A key benefit of the acquisition, according to Johnson, is the influx of engineering talent. This will give AMD an edge in designing complete systems. ""This looks to be like a really great deal for AMD,"" Johnson tells Yahoo Finance. He emphasizes AMD's position as ""the number two player in this space,"" noting that they are ""trying to catch up to what Nvidia's been doing.""

To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that ""the risk of underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting."" He believes that ""so long as that momentum continues,"" the entire tech sector stands to benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and ""are not demanding."" However, he emphasizes that companies must ""deliver on the core business ahead of you today"" to fund their ongoing AI investments. Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that ""it's no longer talk of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers."" When it comes to investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as ""one of the cleaner names"" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

BNY Mellon global head of ETFs Ben Slavin joins Brad Smith in-studio to talk about the ETFs that could also be swayed through their exposures to Nvidia and the AI chip trade: ""One thing that's very important for investors really to understand is what those weights are in the ETFs they hold. Obviously, Nvidia, given the big run-up in the stock, is a significant weight in not just the S&P but a wide variety, several hundred ETFs that hold the stock. And so obviously, depending on which way things go here, you're going to see a big impact, and those ETFs are going to move."" Slavin notes the gains actively managed ETFs have seen over passively managed funds.

Miller notes that bonds (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) and equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) will likely benefit from the Fed's cutting cycle. ""We're playing calendar spreads when it comes to commodities, so we're not betting on the direction of commodity prices, but we're trying to earn the storage costs associated with those,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance. ""We're also trying to pick up the differentials between yields in different countries,"" he continues. He highlights borrowing in Switzerland and Japan as good trades and says that his overall strategy is ""to play it as diversified as we can as to where we're picking up our return streams."" He expects the Fed to cut twice this year, with the first cut starting in September. As rates start to ease, he believes that ""high-margin monopolistic type businesses that have really strong tailwinds"" are poised to benefit. He specifically points to the tech sector and names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) as examples. In addition, he highlights fintech names like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), explaining, ""if you combine inflation with more money coming through the system, combined with taking a little cut off the top of every transaction, those are phenomenal businesses as well.""

Is this a sign of investor enthusiasm waning or is this a small bump on the road to a new record height? S&P Global Ratings technology director Andrew Chang joins Catalysts to give insight into Nvidia's recent earnings report and the current enthusiasm for the AI sector from investors. For his view over Nvidia, Chang explains his AA- credit rating: ""The credit rating's AA- with a stable outlook. We upgraded the company back in April. And to put it plainly, Nvidia is the highest-rated semiconductor company globally, along with TSMC (TSM)... and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) in Korea. So the highest rating from the semi perspective We really like the tech lead that the company has and the strong product execution, thus far."" Chang outlines what could be a risk from a credit perspective: ""The potential for short-term swings in demand despite the long-term massive growth potential.

But we have to remember that this is a long-term growth story, that we should not be so fixated on short-term swings.

Investors may be trying to understand where this slide comes from despite all the hype around AI. Tusk Venture Partners Founder And CEO Bradley Tusk joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into Nvidia's earnings, the AI sector, and the potential for OpenAI's next round of funding. In terms of why Nvidia shares have been sliding, despite a positive Q2 performance, Tusk says: ""Really it's sort of I think speaks to a slightly broader concern, which is at the back of investors minds. They're starting to wonder like, 'hey, are we over inflating this? Is it going too far?' Because they couldn't have really done any better than they did. It's unreasonable. Like 'it's your fault.' It's not their fault. It's a question of are they overvalued and that's collectively our fault, right? "" With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Nvidia is in talks about investing in OpenAI, Tusk comments: ""What's the strategic value for you in having a role with OpenAI? What they all might say is, look, we want a seat at the table. 'We want to know what they're up to. We don't want all of a sudden, Microsoft taking this thing going off in a totally different direction, that we can't compete with.'""

CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination to give insight into Nvidia's recent performance, the market's reaction to its results, and how the company and the sector will operate moving forward. ""So I think this is a situation where nothing's really kind of changed, more of the sell the news kind of event. And listen, at the end of the day, this is a company that beat their numbers. Probably on the data center side we call it about a $1.5 billion or so. And then on the guidance side of things also kind of guided a little bit above the Street, but maybe not as as good as it historically has done,"" Zino tells Yahoo Finance. ""A big reason for that, obviously, is because those sequential kind of gains at this point in time are definitely slowing.""

Nvidia, which in June eclipsed Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, dominates the major stock indexes, making its quarterly results an increasingly high-stakes market event.  In a sign of investor anxiety about Nvidia's ability to beat mounting earnings expectations, the number of shares outstanding in leveraged inverse ETFs that offer a bearish view on the chipmaker grew far more rapidly in recent months than those offering leveraged bullish exposure, issuer data shows.",2024-08-30
2024-08-29 20:30:51,What Nvidia's sell-off is saying about the broader market,"Nvidia (NVDA) posted its second quarter earnings report after the closing bell on Wednesday. The chip giant beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, yet its results failed to impress investors' sky-high expectations, sending shares downward in Thursday's session. US Bank Wealth Management senior investment strategist Rob Haworth joins Market Domination to break down Nvidia's earnings and what investors are looking for moving forward. ""What we saw is investors were somewhat disappointed with the beat. I mean, you had this beat of expectations on the Nvidia side. It's still fairly good news for the future there. But it wasn't quite as good as investors hoped. And I think the challenge is we may be moving kind of past that peak acceleration in artificial intelligence spending. And that's maybe some of the concern we're seeing here,"" Haworth explains. He adds that expectations aren't keeping up with where the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is priced, leading to Nvidia's sell-off seen in Thursday trading. He notes that the phenomenon is also being seen in other tech companies, indicating a rotation occurring in the market.

Stocks experienced their first growth scare in early August as recession fears resurfaced out of the blue. Markets stabilized by month’s end. But the one-two punch of disappointing earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and weakening US economic data has markets back in a tizzy in September.

I think that the August lows of 5,116 [for the S&P 500] are likely going to be tested again, which means that as a long-term investor, you just need to be a little bit cautious,"" Polcari tells Yahoo Finance. He points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity since shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as ""on sale"" for long-term investors. ""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,"" he adds. Polcari argues, ""We're at the very infancy stages of AI. I think Nvidia sits at the nexus of this tech revolution that's happening."" He expects more volatility in the stock as the AI race continues. However, in the long term, he views Nvidia as ""a core name and a core portfolio."" As the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) leads the market's charge for a rebound in Tuesday's trading session, Polcari is more bullish on consumer staples (XLP): ""I think we're already seeing consumers run into problems. We're seeing people live on credit cards, and discretionary is just that — it's discretionary spending. Those are wants versus needs. So I would be cautious on that sector at the moment, and I'd be more focused on the staples sector. While it's boring... I think it plays nicely in an environment where you think it's going to be a little bit of a pressure on the broader market and on the consumer.""

2024-09-10 14:35:15,Expect Nvidia's impact on the market to decrease: Strategist,"The first week of September trading took a toll on Nvidia (NVDA) shares, which is currently trying to recover losses, and weighing on the major averages (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC) as the chip giant struggles to live up to its sky-high expectations. Citigroup head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Morning Brief to discuss Nvidia's outlook and how investors can prepare for a pullback. Chronert notes that while Nvidia is expected to see 40% earnings growth in 2025, its impact on the tech-heavy indexes, particularly the S&P 500, will start to decrease. ""What we're looking at is the pattern over the past 15 months, going back to May of '23, when they first gave us a significant upside surprise and guidance raise. What's happened since then is that they've continued to raise guidance with each quarter, but that stair-step function is decelerating,"" he explains. As Nvidia's guidance lifts continue to decelerate, Chronert argues, ""what this tells us is that it's still a really important stock for index direction. At 6% plus of the index, it's going to be. But in terms of the more significant upside that it's contributed to the S&P, we think that certainly lessens from here."" He adds that when Big Tech and the Magnificent Seven dipped to about in mid-July, he encouraged investors to ""play 'growth' as defensive around concerns of economic weakening."" He calls this strategy ""a pretty good playbook"" as his year-end target for the S&P 500 sits at 5,600. He notes that if the index falls closer to 5,200, ""your risk reward begins to get much more attractive going into the year-end.""

Davidson managing director Gil Luria has excluded Tesla (TSLA) in his Magnificent Seven coverage in the firm's ""compute sector,"" grouping Meta and Alphabet with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA). On Tesla, Luria wrote “if it looks like a duck (greater than 90% of revenue from cars) and quacks like a duck (greater than 90% of profits from cars) it might just be a duck (a car company)"" in a note on Tuesday. Luria sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk more about his call about these tech giants and their investments in AI and computing. ""Those markets require scale, reach, and capital. So unlike previous waves of technology innovation that came from startups, innovation now is coming from... these biggest companies. So these six companies will continue to dominate in AI and spatial computing, and extend their lead from the sectors they're already in — desktop and mobile computing, cloud computing and advertising, computing,"" Luria tells Yahoo Finance. ""They'll keep dominating those and they'll dominate the next two waves."" Luria elaborates on how Meta is differentiating its AI usage and large language models from its Silicon Valley counterparts as prominent tech players continue to spend more on Nvidia chips.

2024-09-10 17:19:52,"Fed eyes new bank regulations, Apple expands ecosystem: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from new capital requirement regulations for banks to the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. The Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined revised capital requirement regulations for banks in a speech on Tuesday morning. The policy, named Basel III Endgame, proposes easements on banks' capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains the Fed's new policy proposal and comments on Barr's speech. Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the ""Chevron deference"" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more ""vulnerable to losing in court"" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. After last week's tech-heavy sell-off, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip. Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity as shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as ""on sale"" for long-term investors. ""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,"" he explains. As Nvidia's (NVDA) stock tumbled in August after failing to meet investors' sky-high earnings expectations, many are now wondering if this is the end of the chip giant's reign over the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down how the index's leadership may change moving forward and how investors can best navigate the market as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. The Biden administration has invested nearly $34 billion in building out domestic semiconductor manufacturing sites in just two years since the CHIPS and Science Act was passed. Former White House CHIPS Coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy Aaron ""Ronnie"" Chatterji commends the government's efforts over the past two years, stating ""the government's done a great job"" in attracting investments from major players like Intel (INTC), Samsung (005930.KS), Micron (MU), SK Hynix (000660.KS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). After Apple (AAPL) held its ""It's Glowtime"" event on Monday, unveiling the new iPhone 16 along with next generation AirPod and Apple Watch devices, Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan explains that the company is ""broadening out the ecosystem,"" highlighting the health and fitness features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods. ""The number of applications that you're seeing is starting to broaden out, which brings in new users into the ecosystem and that's not even including the phone,"" he adds. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. Hatzius believes that a 25-basis-point interest rate cut will be the likely outcome at the September meeting, explaining, ""I think that's more consistent with the data that we've seen since the weaker-than-expected jobs report a month ago."" However, he wouldn't rule out a 50-basis-point cut, arguing that there is a ""solid rationale"" for the larger cut. He explains that the fed funds rate is ""really high,"" the highest among the G10, despite the US making more progress on inflation than other countries in the group. ""So you could certainly make the case that they should be bringing down that rate quickly,"" he explains. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",2024-09-11

KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates ""a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings."" While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: ""I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet."" He argues that Oracle is ""one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward."" He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the ""expansive market"" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a ""proxy for Apple (AAPL),"" noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be ""unabated"" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, ""What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x."" ""So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here,"" he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

At the 2024 Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference, Yahoo Finance reporter Madison Mills interviewed AWS CEO Matt Garman to break down AWS's chip strategy. Garman acknowledges Nvidia's strong market position, calling it ""a great platform"" with a large customer base. However, he emphasizes that the chip market is vast, with ""potential for multiple options,"" stressing the importance of customer choice. AWS's semiconductors, Inferentia and Trainium, are ""specifically built for AI inference,"" Selipsky explains. These chips offer particular value for small-scale inference tasks, helping customers reduce costs. He also notes that AWS is working on improving these chips to train large language models. ""We think that there's this really large market segment and there's room enough for customers to be using the best product for the use case for a long time,"" Selipsky told Yahoo Finance. Although he expressed support for other chipmakers, stating that AWS does not expect to become ""fully reliant"" on its own chips. Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Matt Garman here.

""Perhaps didn't guide upwards as much as the market has liked in the past,"" he said, adding ""the bar is just so high"" for the chipmaker that ""there's easy scope for disappointment."" Draho said Nvidia's market position is promising, given that demand for its products outpaces supply as UBS expects artificial intelligence (AI) spending to accelerate in the next year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference, saying there is ""intense"" demand for the company's chips. ""It's not bad owning these kind of companies that have really strong earnings power, really dominant positions"" rather than ""taking either a lot of cyclical risk or getting too defensive in an environment where ultimately we still think it's going to be a soft landing and a relatively good macro environment over the next six to 12 months,"" Draho tells Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) led the charge for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, climbing more than 8% intraday after comments made by CEO Jensen Huang at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference highlighted continued AI demand. B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the most recent market movement.

He explains, ""[This is] the first time that I can remember we've seen an S&P 500 lose and gain 100 points in a single week."" He notes that volatility is typical for September, and believes that markets ""overreacted"" to CPI data. However, as September is also conference season, comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got investors ""excited about AI again,"" taking markets back up. ""I think that when you take a step back and say, if our biggest concern is that today's modestly hotter core CPI number means the Fed's [Federal Reserve] going to go 25 basis points versus 50, that was consensus coming into the day, right? So it just went from 70% to 85% consensus. So I think it's just a major overreaction in what has become an oversold September tape. And I think that the rally in the afternoon probably makes a whole lot more sense,"" Hogan adds. He notes that semiconductors were down about 23% going into Wednesday's trading day, and argues ""it doesn't take much of a push to get investors back and excited about a group that was trading significantly higher than this just two months ago.""

RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson explains that investors are in a position where they have to put ""blind faith"" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, ""From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers."" Microsoft (MSFT) is cutting about 650 employees from its Xbox gaming unit, the latest move in a string of layoffs that have impacted the video game industry. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Equity Research Michael Pachter points out that in Microsoft's case, these jobs are redundant, stemming from its acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. As for the broader industry, he said hiring increased during the pandemic when people were at home playing video games.

Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss how to play the tech sector. “It's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,” Chronert says. “The leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600."" “Essentially what you have here… is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.” Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citi’s view on the group: “We've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.” He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — who control over 6% of the index — ""those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today. But, what we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now. It's beginning to decelerate.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",2024-09-20

Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) ""had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed.” “Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead.” “Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.” He says, “Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs.” “I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment.” He says “the cooling down of investment” could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. “If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

2024-09-24 21:22:24,Hyperscalers will continue to 'aggressively' invest in AI: Analyst,"CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination to break down the best Big Tech plays for investors. Intel (INTC) unveiled a new pair of AI chips on Tuesday as it seeks to improve its data center business and compete with players like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Zino tells Yahoo Finance, ""Intel will continue to roll out new capabilities, new chip sets, out there in the foreseeable future. But that said, I don't think it necessarily changes anything as far as the Intel story is concerned. That's the fact that this is a company that continues to see its business model under attack."" He notes that AMD has been ""eating market share from Intel"" on the PC and data center front while Nvidia's Blackwell chips rival Intel's CPU business. Zino adds, ""When you kind of look at the CPU industry, it looks like it's really kind of under attack right now as far as where Nvidia where Intel stands at this moment in time."" Thus, he believes the best-case scenario for Intel investors would be a potential acquisition. While Qualcomm (QCOM) has reportedly been in talks about a takeover, he does not believe it will come to fruition: ""I think there's only kind of limited upside in terms of what they could offer out there. Not to mention, I think from a regulatory perspective, I don't think the deal kind of gets anywhere near to being completed."" In the meantime, Zino believes the best Intel can do at this moment is to cut operating expenses and return to positive free cash flow. In addition, he's looking for momentum in its foundry business, hoping it will gain traction from external customers. He adds, ""If you're an Intel investor, you're essentially a value stock at this at this point in time, hoping for improved profitability metrics to kind of get the stock going a little bit."" While AI drove markets to new heights during the first half of the year, the second half of the year has seen many investors grow concerned about returns on AI spending. ""Our view right now is that as far as kind of the mega-cap tech companies out there is concerned, they will continue to spend as long as kind of their business models, their revenue trajectory continues to hold up. And we think that will be the case in terms of cloud spend, in terms of digital ad spend going into 2025, and also kind of the compute trajectory here over the next decade,"" Zino explains. He continues, ""The fact that improving compute metrics over the next couple of years will potentially drive greater AI monetization, new use cases for AI, I think, is a very interesting proposition and a reason why these hyperscalers will need to continue to aggressively invest. So for that reason, we continue to think there is stabilization past 2025."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

2024-09-25 15:48:59,How Nvidia's Blackwell chips can help solve AI's energy problem,"One of the biggest concerns AI players like Nvidia (NVDA) have to contend with is increased energy use. Dion Harris, Nvidia's head of data center product marketing, joins Catalysts to discuss the heightened energy demand and how the energy efficiency of Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. ""Blackwell was purpose-built from the ground up to really make sure it could deliver the most performance and efficiency,"" Harris tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that the Blackwell processor is coupled with the Grace CPU to offer two times more energy efficiency than the standard x86 CPU. He adds, ""And then of course, we also looked at how do they communicate to each other. So we have a proprietary communication protocol called NVLink, which allows GPUs to connect to each other at very high speeds, and that eliminates a lot of the bottlenecks and therefore drives more efficiency."" Thus, Harris explains that the whole system is designed to deliver ""incredible performance"" at 25 times more energy efficiency than Nvidia's previous generation. When it comes to energy, he believes there are two parts of the equation: short-term and long-term. In the short-term, many of Nvidia's customers do not have the means to quickly build efficient data centers. Thus, Blackwell chips provide ""a huge uplift in terms of the productivity they can get out of their existing power assets."" In the long-term, Nvidia is working closely with partners and energy providers to ensure that data centers are being built as efficiently as possible and that grid infrastructure is resilient. ""AI is going to be critical to enabling sort of the next wave of infrastructure. We talk about the grids as one sort of key use case, but it will also play out in manufacturing and aeronautics and a number of heavy industries,"" Harris notes.

2024-09-26 14:07:50,Micron is in a 'cyclical upswing': Analyst,"Micron Technology (MU) posted fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The semiconductor giant also raised its guidance for the next quarter, sparking a widespread rally in global chip markets. Morningstar Equity Analyst of Technology William Kerwin joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on Micron following the beat-and-raise. Kerwin acknowledges that the results ""were nothing short of impressive,"" but notes that this doesn't alter his long-term view on the company. He emphasizes that Micron is currently riding ""a cyclical upswing"" in memory demand, which he expects to continue through 2025. However, he cautions that this dynamic will eventually decelerate, suggesting that the current rally ""is a correction from too much pessimism"" from investors, even as the fundamentals remain robust. ""As much as we liked the print, [and] we like the next four quarters for Micron, we still see long-term cyclicality in the future,"" Kerwin states. He believes this cyclical nature will ultimately weigh on the share price, leading him to maintain a target of $110, despite the stock hitting that milestone on the heels of this earnings report.

2024-09-25 18:33:27,"China's economic stimulus, AI's energy problem: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day. A new World Economic Forum report warns that global long-term growth is at risk due to high worldwide debt and political instability. World Economic Forum Managing Director Saadia Zahidi paints a mixed picture of economist opinions. Most are cautiously optimistic, with 54% saying the economy is ""relatively stable."" However, 37% believe it ""could get a little bit worse,"" while only 9% expect improvement. However, she mentions that economists are particularly upbeat about US growth prospects. The US sports betting industry has exploded in recent years, with platforms like FanDuel leading the charge. As the NFL season kicks off, Peter Jackson, CEO of Flutter (FLUT) (FanDuel's parent company), expresses enthusiasm about Flutter's growth prospects. He projects the North American market to reach a staggering $70 billion, with global markets (excluding the US) reaching $300 billion. The CEO attributes this success to ""the quality"" of FanDuel, which he calls ""the best in the market"" in terms of value and user experience. This edge, he claims, ""is what is enabling us to win"" against competitors. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday after the announcement of a stimulus package from China’s central bank. Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick argues that US investors should be rooting for China's economy because if they fail, it will have serious ripple effects on the global economy. ""I think we have to remember how in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, one of the things that helped us dramatically was that the Chinese economy was expanding so rapidly. And as a result, it had spillover effects into the rest of the world. The flip side is if their economy shrinks dramatically, that will also have spillover effects into the rest of the world,"" he explains. Intel (INTC) is under pressure as it navigates a slew of missteps while falling behind names like Nvidia (NVDA) in the heated chip race. Eric Jackson, the founder and president of EMJ Capital argues, “I don't see a quick fix here. I don't see a lever to pull, whether it's taking money from Apollo, separating the company into two businesses.” Apollo Global Management (APO), which is Yahoo's parent company, has reportedly offered a multibillion-dollar investment in the legacy chipmaker. There have also been reports that the company is considering splitting into two to separate its foundry segment from the rest of its business. “All of these roads I see leading to basically a ten-year slog in trying to turn this company around to fix the cultural issues. And unfortunately, that's just I don't see any faster way for Intel,” Jackson explains. Meanwhile, one of the biggest concerns AI players like Nvidia (NVDA) have to contend with is increased energy use. Dion Harris, Nvidia's head of data center product marketing, believes there are two parts of the energy equation: short-term and long-term. In the short-term, many of Nvidia's customers do not have the means to quickly build efficient data centers. Thus, its newest Blackwell chips provide ""a huge uplift in terms of the productivity they can get out of their existing power assets."" In the long-term, Nvidia is working closely with partners and energy providers to ensure that data centers are being built as efficiently as possible and that grid infrastructure is resilient. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company identifies three key areas of opportunity driving this growth: the development of larger data centers, enterprise and sovereign AI initiatives, and ongoing improvements in software efficiency and capabilities.

Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager, joins Market Domination Overtime hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to break down what the report tells investors about the company. Morgan explains, ""It does appear that they are beginning to see a real good benefit from HBM, which, of course, is the high bandwidth memory that's used with the AI chip. So we're coming out of a down cycle. We've had a couple of good quarters. Now we're getting this AI top over the numbers, and it looks like they did gain from that. Looking across Micron's segments, Morgan highlights how important memory driven by AI chip demand supported the earnings beat. ""Smartphones and PCs aren't doing that great,"" the analyst says. ""They're just starting to get out of the hole, and you have other applications, industrial auto, and so forth. And you're right. If you look at DRAM pricing in terms of spot pricing, it's just kind of leveled out...[Micron's] main markets, which are across the board, there's flash memory and there's DRAM chips. Just about everything is still kind of muted, right? It's still trying to get going. So if you were to take out this AI component, the data server space, we probably wouldn't be talking about it because it's just kind of just slowly unthawing."" Morgan says he hopes the company will provide more color about how it expects to gain from Nvidia's (NVDA) new AI chip, Blackwell, which uses its HBM tech. ""It's all going to be about 'how much of a positive effect are you getting this?'"" The analysts indicates his projections are consistent with reports that Micron expects HBM to be sold out this year into next.

2024-09-26 22:34:44,"Super Micro Computer DOJ probe, streaming wars: Market Domination","On today's episode of Market Domination, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down some of the biggest stories from the trading day, from fresh labor market data to the state of the streaming wars. Initial jobless claims (the number of people filing for new unemployment applications) hit a four-month low, according to the latest Labor Department data. Michael Darda, Roth Capital Partners chief economist and macro strategist tells Yahoo Finance, “If you look at first-time claims in isolation, it really doesn't look like there's anything wrong with this labor market whatsoever. Unfortunately, that is not the whole story.” The latest labor market differential report, which shows the difference between the share of consumers who view jobs as “plentiful” compared to those who view jobs as “hard to get,” fell to its lowest reading since March 2021. Darda says the recent decline in the labor market differential “would be consistent with the unemployment rate continuing to creep [up], eventually towards 5% and that would throw us back into the recession alarm bell camp.” Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are plummeting after a report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities. On the other hand, chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are rising in sympathy with Micron (MU) after it issued strong first quarter guidance. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the AI product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company global technology and cloud services practice chairman David Crawford sees three ""broad pockets of growth"" for AI. First, large hyperscalers building out their capabilities are generating ""enormous"" demand. The second pocket for growth lies in enterprise adoption. The third growth area will likely be seen in independent software vendors that build AI capabilities for their products and run them in their own data centers. As the streaming wars heat up, Macquarie US equity research senior media tech analyst Tim Nollen remains Neutral on one of the biggest players: Disney (DIS). Nollen explains that there are several areas that will ""hit Disney's PNL (profit and loss) balance sheet and cash flows over the next couple of years."" However, ESPN direct-to-consumer will be the biggest factor. He calls this ""the largest event in the streaming landscape"" since the launch of Disney+, and believes that offering ESPN direct-to-consumer will likely cause cord-cutting to accelerate.

Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. “We have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,” Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, “We are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.” The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners “used more indirect exposure than direct buying,” with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “that have significant weighting to these names.” He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were ""within the context of also adding to things like"" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). ""I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.” Browne also has focused on ""standouts within leading sectors."" He says ""Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.""

2024-10-03 21:27:03,How Helene damage in one town could disrupt the chip sector,"Hurricane Helene may have an unexpected impact on the chip sector. A small town in North Carolina called Spruce Pines produces a significant portion of the quartz needed to make semiconductors. The storm devastated the town and halted mining operations. Peter Hanbury, Bain & Company partner, and leader of operations for technology practice, joins Josh Schafer and Madison Mills on Market Domination Overtime to discuss the potential impact on chipmakers. “The situation in North Carolina has the potential to have a big impact on the industry if it lasts for more than six months… The high-purity quartz produced is really critical to the industry in two ways. It helps produce the silicon wafers that form the basis of all semiconductor products, and it's also used in the wafer manufacturing tools used by TSMC (TSM), Intel (INTC), and Micron (MU).” Supply bottlenecks are “one of the challenges of the industry” since there are limited options for chipmakers to find the resources needed to produce the tech. Hanbury says, “The best players in the industry recognize these bottlenecks and spend a lot of time identifying where these bottlenecks are, developing proactive mitigation plans like additional inventory and monitoring their supply base.” Hanbury reports, “We see several months of inventory along the value chain, which will limit the immediate impact… We don't know the exact impact of the damage or how long it will take to get the facilities up and going again, but we think there's at least a couple of months of inventory to limit the immediate impact.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

2024-10-03 18:20:11,"Jobless claims data, market volatility, China stocks: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market and report on some of the biggest stories of the trading day. All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, ""when are they perfectly certain?"" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that ""through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward."" Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout ""Magnificent Seven"" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the ""very, very early innings."" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, ""Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.""

2024-10-08 21:57:21,"Climate risks for housing, office demand rises: Asking for a Trend","On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the top stories and key themes from the trading day. As Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida, First Street and Zillow (Z) are teaming up to create a first-of-its-kind rating system to assess climate risks on for-sale properties. The monitored risks include heat, wind, and most importantly, flooding. First Street head of climate implications Jeremy Porter explains, ""Our mission has always been to quantify and communicate climate risk, and when we first started about eight years ago, there were really very few resources that people had for understanding what their climate risk looked like and the resources that did exist for things like FEMA zones... So what we ended up doing was creating our own hazard models at the property level so people could understand not only what the risk is today, but what the risk is into the future, what the risk is to their specific property, and how that might impact their pocketbooks."" Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre breaks down his top takeaways from the trading day. The market is seeing mixed risk signals as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just shy of a fresh record high on Tuesday while ten-year bond yields (^TNX) closed above 4%. Meanwhile, the risks associated with a no-landing scenario for the US economy have been reignited after September's jobs report came in much hotter than expected. The AI trade has also bounced back, as Nvidia (NVDA) closed close to its record high. The US office market reached an important milestone in the third quarter as the overall availability rate peaked and began declining for the first time in more than five years. JLL CEO of Americas Markets John Gates explains, ""It's been slowly recovering for some time now, maybe even 18 months. We saw an acceleration, though, in the third quarter and some of the statistics start to look pretty good. Total leasing volumes in Q2 and Q3 were about 86% of pre-pandemic levels, which is the highest that it's been."" He identifies New York as a major active market, and also points to the following cities as expanding markets: Dallas, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; and Atlanta, Georgia. Recession concerns have been prevalent on Wall Street, but key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are not aligning with historical recession trends. Market Domination Anchor Julie Hyman breaks down the details, exploring the relationship between unemployment rates typically seen during recessions and how the current situation differs.

2024-10-16 17:05:30,It's 'unclear' if US AI chip controls work: Strategist,"The US government is reportedly considering capping AI chip sales to certain countries. The move would affect chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Macrolens founder, chief strategist, and managing principal Brian McCarthy joins Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss the potential export rules and how they could affect the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. “It's unclear whether yesterday's news suggesting there could be tightened restrictions on the UAE and Saudi Arabia is or isn't related to those countries possibly funneling chips to China because it's very hard to sort of bottle up China's access to these chips through third parties,” McCarthy tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that despite the US limiting chip exports to China due to national security risks, widespread smuggling of the tech persists. Due to chip smugglers, “There are many, many holes in this net,” McCarthy says, adding the US government’s export rules are doing something as “clearly the cost of accessing these chips has gone up for Chinese entities, but the net has a lot of holes in it, and it's really unclear how effective these controls are slowing China's ambitions in the AI and other related spaces.” The strategist says beyond the effectiveness of the rules of keeping the chips out of China another question is how much national defense prerogatives “are tied up in the economic race.” He adds, “That’s really unclear to what extent each of those factors is driving US policy at this point. Clearly, AI has a lot of applications in defense that it's important that each side feels it's important that they have access to. As far as the economic stuff goes, it’s interesting to speculate as to whether that may change.” “I know [China is] behind in chips, and [the US will] continue to move forward."" McCarthy says, adding “it is a question of whether there's justification on economic grounds to be trying to halt the advancement of any country that's just trying to build businesses.” McCarthy notes his view that the US doesn’t “really need to go out of our way to halt China's economic advancement. They have plenty of domestic problems that they are contending with at this point.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

The Dutch equipment maker said net bookings that represent orders were 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter—less than half of what Wall Street was expecting and a major miss for a company whose lithography gear is a must-have for the most advanced chip manufacturing.

2024-10-17 15:10:52,Why TSMC is a 'bellwether' for the AI trade,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) leads chip stocks higher after reporting better-than-expected third quarter results and raising its 2025 sales forecast. The earnings beat seemed to reassure investors' confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) after ASML Holding (ASML) trimmed its guidance, sending semiconductor stocks lower. TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss his view that TSMC’s earnings beat is more indicative of the AI chip market than ASML’s weakness. O’Donnell tells Yahoo Finance that ASML’s outlook cut “increasingly is going to look like this unusual blip for the semiconductor industry in general.” He explains that issues in the China region and challenges with Intel (INTC) and Samsung (005930.KS) contributed to ASML trimming its guidance, emphasizing that “it's not an overall industry thing.” “TSMC is [a] much better bellwether of where things are going,” the analyst says. “Bottom line, we saw not only the huge beat and then the raise [but also] the discussion even into next year,” indicating demand strength that is expected to continue being strong. “Clearly, I think the people are having a hard time accepting it, but look, this AI thing is real. The demand is real. It's continuing. And there's a lot of opportunity moving forward.” He adds, ""TSMC is just extraordinarily well-positioned, and that's why there's so much focus on them because what happens there really drives the vast majority, especially, of the high-end semiconductor market that we're seeing for AI.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

2024-10-16 22:53:55,"Election cybersecurity, AI in healthcare: Asking for a Trend","On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the biggest stories and key themes from the trading day. Arctic Wolf has released its new Human Risk Report today, which analyzes some of the top cybersecurity risks facing companies. Nick Schneider, Arctic Wolf president and CEO, calls the election ""an event that sparks a lot of interest from bad actors."" He explains, ""I think during an election year or any time there's an event that has significant interest in the public sphere, you're going to get increased interest and increased activity from the bad actors, both against businesses, but also against individuals, and kind of where those two meet or intersect is also additional risk to individual organizations."" BJ Schaknowski, CEO of symplr, discusses the state of the healthcare industry as AI becomes increasingly adopted. Schaknowski explains that symplr is helping hospitals become more productive by helping with tasks associated with compliance, quality, and safety. He notes these tasks have been ""wildly fragmented"" in hospitals, working ""against the productivity of critical healthcare workers who should be providing care, not sitting in front of a laptop, inputting data."" Schaknowski notes that nurses spend about three to five hours a day in front of a computer screen when they instead can be focused on mentoring newer nurses and spending more time caring for patients. Yahoo Finance Data and Markets Editor Jared Blikre breaks down some of his biggest takeaways from the trading day as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at a record high and the volatility index (^VIX) is down just below 20. Big Tech's CapEx spending on AI is on the path higher into the last quarter of 2024. Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman examines hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms' (META) investments into generative AI and data centers, putting more fuel into Nvidia's (NVDA) figurative AI chip fire. Finally, Josh Lipton checks on some of the stocks moving most in after-hours trading: Lucid (LCID), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and Alcoa (AA).

""Nvidia has had a nice, sharp, near-term rebound as part of largely a choppy rangebound triangle pattern that's been intact really since the summer — June, July,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. However, he believes the stock will likely stall out between $140 and $145. ""I don't see it going to 180 right away. I think there's a great case to be made about why this company and the stock is phenomenal long-term. I just don't see it,"" he explains. ""I think, in general, it's going to consolidate in November. That's going to be your buying opportunity. Still great to buy and hold long term here,"" he concludes.

But how can investors gain exposure to these megacap tech names without buying individual stocks? Calamos Investments senior vice president and head of ETFs Matt Kaufman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss investing strategies. Kaufman points out that the Magnificent Seven trade continues to drive strong market returns, with the group up 40% this year. He notes, ""The Mag Seven is still accounting for a significant portion"" of market gains, even as the other 493 S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies are starting to gain momentum. ""If the leadership in the Mag 7 stops continuing going forward, maybe the innovation doesn't keep up at the same pace, then you would want exposure to those other names as well,"" Kaufman advises. He suggests investors consider CANQ (CANQ), an ETF that provides exposure to top names using options to remain defensive. ""We're seeing a lot of folks moving into this options-based strategy, which really allows you to control the exposure you want to these Mag 7 names and to others,"" Kaufman explains.

2024-10-16 17:31:46,"Investment banking activity rises, bitcoin rallies: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day. Major US banks have all reported their earnings. Morgan Stanley (MS) closed out the group, topping analysts' expectations and delivering a big boost in investment banking revenue. American Banker editor-in-chief Chana Schoenberger explains that her biggest takeaway from bank earnings is that ""investment banking is up and trading is up."" She attributes this trend to two factors: the markets being up and an increase in dealmaking. She notes that M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has increased this year and will continue its momentum as interest rates fall. Regional banks Citizens Financial Group (CFG) and US Bancorp (USB) have posted their third quarter results. Citizens Bank posted revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations of lower net interest income. On the other hand, US Bancorp's net interest income topped estimates, as it benefited from higher borrowing costs. Major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are rallying amid third quarter earnings season. However, questions remain about the sustainability of these gains in the current bull market, which is entering its third year. IG North America CEO J.J. Kinahan expresses optimism about the market's broad-based rally, viewing it as a positive indicator. ""We're at a wall of worry. Nobody believes in the rally,"" he says, suggesting this skepticism could fuel further gains. However, he highlights some sector-specific concerns, particularly in semiconductor stocks. Kinahan points to Intel (INTC) as ""an outlier"" among semiconductor names, noting the stock's difficulty maintaining momentum. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices have climbed above $67,000 on Wednesday — its highest since July. The jump was influenced by Vice President Kamala Harris's newly announced proposals to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. The cryptocurrency's upward momentum has triggered a broader rally across crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and CleanSpark (CLSK). The US government is reportedly considering capping chip sales to certain countries. The move would affect chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Macrolens chief strategist and managing principal Brian McCarthy tells Yahoo Finance, ""It's unclear whether yesterday's news suggesting there could be tightened restrictions on the UAE and Saudi Arabia is or isn't related to those countries possibly funneling chips to China because it's very hard to sort of bottle up China's access to these chips through third parties."" He explains that despite the US limiting chip exports to China due to national security risks, widespread smuggling of the tech persists. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",2024-10-17

Hull emphasizes the company's focus on ""strategic partnerships,"" highlighting Nvidia as a key collaborator ""at the tip of the spear"" in AI and technology. He notes that this partnership with Nvidia will give the company ""unique and special access"" to cutting-edge AI capabilities in restaurant automation. A prime example of this collaboration is the Flippy fry station, powered by Nvidia's Vision AI technology. This system automates the fry-cooking process for various foods, including french fries, chicken nuggets, onion rings, and tacos. ""It takes over the heavy lifting on the fry station so you can take that labor and you can redeploy them somewhere else that brings far more impact in the restaurant,"" Hull explains. As far as the cost of the technology, Hull notes that it will be the same price as hiring a human to do the labor, so there is no ""downside"" for companies.

Looking at the Magnificent Seven specifically, Polcari says ""AI is going to absolutely continue to crush it."" He nods to a report from Dan Ives ""talking about now the second derivative of AI.""

2024-10-30 15:30:14,Ditch AMD and 'just go with the pure play' Nvidia,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fall after the chipmaker reported third quarter results, with its fourth quarter outlook failing to impress investors. The AMD sell-off fueled a pullback in Nvidia stock as the weaker-than-anticipated guidance fuels some concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) chip demand. Harvest Portfolio Management CIO and Wall Street Beats partner Paul Meeks tells Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down the results and what it means for the company and the AI space. Meeks says, “I have a third of my portfolio in Nvidia. It's been a rock star. I don't think what AMD said yesterday is going to put Nvidia in peril, and with the big move that Nvidia has already seen [and] the fact that it's only down 1% today on AMD's sins, I actually think is a pretty good sign.” He adds, “The problem [with AMD] is not an AI accelerator chip pure play. It's got a CPU business, too, and that business right now kind of sucks. And so the way I look at it, even though AMD will be a viable number two to Nvidia in the AI chip market, and even though the stock trades at a discount to Nvidia, I just go with the pure play. I just buy more Nvidia on this news and continue to avoid AMD, which has been a good trade for me.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

2024-10-30 21:12:00,Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence,"Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

Bokeh Capital Partners founder and CIO Kimberly Forrest joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from potential changes in the CHIPS Act. Forrest tells Yahoo Finance she doesn't expect the CHIPS Act to end under President Joe Biden's successor, but there will likely be changes. ""I don't think it's going to end, but I do think the rules are probably going to be revised. I think the current administration put a lot of provisions in that may be slowing down the actual building of chip plants and chips. So I think if either one of them wins, they're going to have to look at that and see how quickly they want the CHIPS Act to actually affect the chips being produced in America."" She adds, ""I'm somebody that really believes in the CHIPS Act because so much is created in Taiwan, and I don't think the normal investor, or even especially the normal consumer, doesn't realize where all of the electronics start, which is on the island of Taiwan that is very close to China. And China would really like to own that outright [and] drive what happens in Taiwan."" The strategist highlights Micron (MU), AMD (AMD), and Synopsys (SNPS) as her top AI picks.

""The reaction is really keying off of is just the very high amount of spending that's going into AI and the very uncertain payoffs and far-out potential payoffs that would be coming from those from the mega-cap tech companies that have such a large weighting in the index ... It makes sense that the market isn't going to get enthusiastic about that,"" Ma tells the Morning Brief team. He notes, ""We do think 2025 is going to be a healthy year for earnings growth.

""In order to add Nvidia, obviously, you had to take something out, and Intel was a difficulty,"" Silverblatt tells Yahoo Finance, explaining that because the index is price-weighted, Intel's low price, relative to others in the index, ""did not have a material impact on the index when it was moving, [and] didn't represent the weighting within the index where we wanted to."" ""Nvidia, on the other hand, even though it is less than the average stock ... does better represent the field and has more of an impact on the index,"" he adds. Silverblatt notes that Sherwin Williams (SHW), which was added to the Dow along with Nvidia, ""has a lot more weight than Nvidia"" because the index is price-weighted.

Intel has been a fixture in the benchmark index since 1999, but its shares have plummeted nearly 48% throughout 2024. Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox tells Morning Brief that this change will introduce Nvidia to a broader audience. ""Really, most of America knows the Dow, so a lot of America is gonna be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story,"" she notes. However, Cox points out that the Dow is not a market-cap-weighted index, so Nvidia's inclusion will not have the same significant impact as it would on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) or Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).

2024-11-08 13:00:02,Nvidia enters the Dow: Why the stock could still double,"The tech stock landscape may look quite different over the next four years with President-elect Donald Trump returning to office. For one, AI regulation of some form will likely have to come from the Trump administration as the fast-moving technology was not clamped down on by the Biden administration. Is that regulation soft or anti-AI innovation? That’s one of the key questions investors will aim to figure out. At the same time, questions will swirl over whether a Trump administration plans to move forward with a breakup of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and possibly, others in big-cap tech. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson. The pair dive into the outlook for market darling Nvidia (NVDA) and AI more broadly in the wake of Donald Trump’s historic White House win. Trump’s win will also likely have ramifications for the Big Tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) that dominate the ""popular Magnificent Seven"" complex. Is there one big name in tech that investors should own over another? Nvidia is also entering the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which may add further gains to the stock Jackson hints.

2024-11-08 21:24:11,"It's 'very, very difficult' to decouple US from China on chips","As investors assess the impact of former President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on China after he secured reelection, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss where a second Trump term leaves the semiconductor industry and top chipmakers, like Nvidia (NVDA). ""There's a number of areas where I think Trump is probably going to have an impact [on the chips sector],"" Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance, explaining ""one is certainly tariffs"" and ""one is the CHIPS Act because it does sound like at least the Republicans maybe have a different vision for what that ought to be."" He adds, ""There's a there's a lot of things that he can do beyond just sort of the general volatility around the economy and everything else, both in the US and globally, that is likely to increase under a Trump administration."" On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the Joe Biden administration's CHIPS Act and proposed a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports. The semiconductor industry is ""one of the most global industries,"" the analyst says. On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says ""I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go."" He explains, ""The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop."" Rasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs ""would have massive implications both in and out of semis."" He notes that there wouldn't be ""a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs"" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. "" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.""

2024-11-11 16:30:38,How a Trump presidency would impact Big Tech,"Following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election, tech CEOs were quick to send congratulatory messages. However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. ""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

2024-11-11 18:00:00,"How Big Tech, AI could fit into Trump's immigration policies","Investors are increasingly optimistic that the technology sector will benefit immensely from Donald Trump's second presidential term. This sentiment is fueled by Trump's pro-crypto stance, the prospect of reduced regulation, and the backing of influential tech CEO Elon Musk. Frontier Foundry Co-Founder and CEO Sultan Meghji joins Catalysts to share his outlook on this emerging trend. ""Even if we just go back to something that looks like a Trump 1.0, and I actually think they'll go farther than that, it'll still be quite a big swing,"" he states, anticipating significant deregulatory measures across the federal bureaucracy that will further energize the AI and crypto markets. Meghji believes that this time around, the Trump administration will view these transformative technologies as ""growth measures for the economy versus things to be managed."" He notes that AI and crypto are ""fundamentally things that should be built and sold out of the United States both for our own use here and globally,"" presenting a ""huge opportunity"" that the president-eleft understands. However, Meghji expresses concern over Trump's mass deportation plans, calling them ""a huge issue."" While acknowledging the desire to attract the ""best and the brightest"" talent, he also points out that immigrants have faced challenges finding open jobs in the US. Ultimately, Meghji says, ""it comes down to what are they actually going to do and how they are going to execute against that,"" suggesting the tech community could play a role in streamlining the immigration process.

Kerwin believes these companies may seek to diversify their trade relationships to regions like India or Southeast Asia, stating ""it will be a trend across the sector."" However, he cautions that high China exposure does not necessarily equate to high investment risk, saying, ""You really have to unpack what's in that exposure."" Regarding regulatory impacts, Kerwin thinks ""there could still be some antitrust [action] against the largest of tech companies."" But he also expects ""M&A deals at the rung just below those largest of largest tech companies can start to pick up again over the next four years.""

SoundHound AI Co-Founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the company's products — which offers its AI-powered voice platform to enterprise customers — earnings results, and growing customer base. Mohajer tells Yahoo Finance that the company ""had a great quarter,"" passing the $25 million revenue mark for the first time and delivering a beat and raise. SoundHound narrowed its expected losses for the quarter to $0.04 per share. He says that SoundHound AI's gross margin was affected by ""short-term temporary impacts"" like acquisition costs that ""should improve over time."" The CEO says customers from different industries are using its tech: ""We spent more than ten years just in R&D [research and development] to build our own AI models and voice recognition in dozens of languages. And then we started monetizing it. First, we were very big in automotive, and then we went to AI customer service, and our vision was always to diversify."" He adds that is expanding beyond just the autos and restaurant industries, with the goal of being in ""all the enterprise brands."" This includes ventures into spaces like healthcare, insurance, financials, governments, and retail. ""Some of that has been organic growth, and some of it has been through our acquisitions,"" Mohajer says. While some executives, like IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna, say that AI is poised to replace human workers, Mohajer argues ""there's going to be a disruption, but I think it's going to be net positive,"" explaining that while some jobs may be replaced, others will be created as AI integration boosts productivity.

Mariner Wealth Advisors chief investment strategist and head of equities Jeff Krumpelman joins Morning Brief to discuss his expectations for the report. ""Nvidia is just a beast,"" Krumpelman states, highlighting the company's exceptional revenue growth, profit performance, and competitive advantages within the chip landscape. He points to Nvidia's ""ecosystem"" of products, saying it puts the semiconductor giant ""heads and shoulders above competition."" Hennion & Walsh chief investment officer Kevin Mahn has previously described to Yahoo Finance that Nvidia's ultimate goal is to become the ""hub of the AI ecosystem."" While acknowledging that the company's previous ""triple level growth"" is slowing, Krumpelman remains bullish. ""This is an innovative company that's continued to push on that front,"" he explains, anticipating continued product and software developments that will expand margins. ""Expectations are high going into this quarter, but we think the secular trends and demand for generative AI is just there,"" Krumpelman notes, adding that he views any potential stock price dip following the earnings report as ""a buying opportunity.""

Bloomberg Intelligence senior tech industry analyst Mandeep Singh joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what's next for the chipmaker as it looks for Gelsinger's replacement as the company struggles to keep up in the artificial intelligence (AI) space dominated by Nvidia (NVDA) ""For a company like Intel to have this sort of uncertainty when they were not executing well. If you are a customer of Intel, which a lot of the hyperscaler and the enterprise companies are, when it comes to the Intel CPUs, you would rather go to Nvidia, which you were going there already for the AI accelerators,"" Singh says. He notes that a key risk of ousting Gelsinger for Intel is the associated uncertainty that deters customers. ""For the board to bring anybody new without having the sort of credentials that Pat had really would create more uncertainty and, probably, market share loss to hyperscalers doing their own chips."" ""Pat Gelsinger had all the credentials. So the fact that he couldn't turn it around just goes to show how tough it is to turn around a company like Intel."" The analyst explains Intel's current challenges are exacerbated by stiff competition among chipmakers in the Nvidia-dominated AI era. ""The thing about semiconductor chip making is once you fall behind ... the dominant company continues to gain share and they really have sort of a monopoly."" He says this pattern has played out before in the semiconductor market with Intel being on the other side of the dynamic when it held a dominant position in the central processing unit (CPU) market.

The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).

""Nobody should be surprised to hear about an ongoing set of probes against Nvidia, especially coming from China,"" Newman says, explaining there are ""two sides to this one:"" the ""ongoing microaggressions that exist between Chinese and US firms"" and ""China [continuing] to struggle to keep up with the most leading edge advanced AI chip"" so ""they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down."" The US has limited the export of semiconductors to China to minimize China's access to advanced chips. President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to enforce a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.

Mahoney noted that Netflix is no stranger to stock splits, having previously executed them in February 2004 and July 2015. With Netflix trading above $900, he explained, ""There's a good precedent that once a stock gets over $600... to do a split."" He pointed to Nvidia (NVDA) as a recent example, which completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year and was subsequently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The CEO further highlighted that a stock split would attract more investors to Netflix shares. The current price may be ""out of reach for the average investor,"" but a split would open the stock to a broader demographic. Mahoney forecasts that Netflix could potentially opt for a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility.

2024-12-16 17:30:00,Trump & chip sector: Investors need 'supply chain resilience plan',"President-elect Donald Trump has made tariffs a key focus of his second term in the White House, proposing a 60% tariff on all goods from China. The impact of Trump's second term on the semiconductor sector, which has become especially important during the artificial intelligence (AI) era, has been debated, given the impact of tariffs and uncertainty around the CHIPS and Science Act. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller join Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss their outlook for the chip sector under Trump 2.0. Moorhead expects Trump to be a ""net positive"" for the chip sector: ""Trump doesn't want to be the president that tanked the tech stock market, and he certainly could do that if he puts any weight on the chip stocks that have been a tremendous part of the growth over the last four years."" ""With all of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing leaving the United States, or most of it, Trump's trying to get the best deal to bring it back in. I do not believe he will tank the stock market or major industries to make that happen,"" Moorhead notes. Miller — the author of Chip War: The Fight for World's Most Critical Technology — says Trump's chip policy is ""being defined right now by the president-elect and his incoming administration,"" adding that tariffs will likely be a key component of his approach to the semiconductor sector, though there will likely be negotiations between his proposals and the actual policies. Amid uncertainty about Trump's actual policies and their impacts on chipmakers, Moorhead cautions investors saying they ""should be looking into every one of their investment plays and seeing if they have a supply chain resilience plan. It's a what if [plan]."" Watch the video above to learn more about the US-China trade war, the impact of major chipmakers, and more.

""This is not the end of the world for Nvidia,"" Woods emphasizes. While the stock is currently under scrutiny as the only Magnificent Seven stock declining since November 1, Woods maintains that Nvidia remains fundamentally strong. He says overall, the stock is still in an uptrend. However, he sees a ""near-term head and shoulders top"" formation, which he views as a potential buying opportunity for investors. ""The fundamental story hasn't changed, nothing has changed there,"" Woods tells Madison Mills. ""To me, this is just a pause."" Addressing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's movement, Woods notes the index is down 3.78% in its nine day losing streak, with UnitedHealth (UNH) leading the decline by erasing 725 points. ""The move is just a garden variety sell-off, but the amount of stocks that are down is a little head-scratching,"" he states.

""We were the largest bitcoin mining company for the past three years, and that's really driven by the fact that we had to bring in traditional data center people to actually run the business. That's really been our differentiator,"" Sullivan tells Yahoo Finance. The CEO says, ""We think of ourselves as a digital infrastructure company, whether it's building data centers for bitcoin mining or whether it's building data centers to host hundreds of megawatts of [Nvidia's (NVDA)] GB200 that you guys were talking about earlier, you know, our core competency is driven through large-scale digital infrastructure."" Looking to 2025, the company expects ""a relatively equal split"" between crypto mining and AI. Sullivan adds, ""Our expectation is to continue to grow the data center part of the business, which is just a radical shift from the high volatility bitcoin mining space moving into the data center space"" as the ""long-term contracts"" provide ""a lot of long-term and free cash-flow stability that investors really enjoy.""

D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria breaks down the chipmaker's stock moves during the trading day and explains why he considers himself the ""least bullish"" Wall Street analyst covering Nvidia. ""I like to think of myself as maybe the least bullish of the 60-something analysts that cover Nvidia,"" Luria says. ""The reason is that I think this is a cycle just like any other cycle we've ever seen, which is to say: This may be the peak year of the cycle."" The analyst continues, ""For Nvidia stock to be attractive from here, you would need to believe that it can grow 15, 20% into next year and the year after that. We think that that may not happen."" Luria notes that hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are unlikely to continue spending at their current monumental rate and that sovereign artificial intelligence customers are unlikely to make up for any normalization of Big Tech capital spending.

""I think we peaked in late December,"" Woods explains. ""What I look at is the overall breadth of the market, and the breadth has been very negative."" The strategist elaborates on his outlook for the 2025 economy: ""Equities are going to get jittery, and we're going to sell off a little bit. This is a normal correction in a secular bull market."" He continues, ""Nothing fundamentally has changed, but we're worried about taxes and the implications it has on inflation. We have a new administration coming in; we're not certain how that's going to play out."" Despite the uncertainty, Woods clarifies that what's happening now is not unprecedented, noting that ""10% corrections happen, on average, every 18 months"" and the economy is simply in the midst of that cycle. ""I'm not looking to make headlines by saying we're in the midst of a correction,"" Woods says. ""People see that, and they get a little spooked. I think it's a buying opportunity.""

Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) lagged behind with a more limited AI presence that caused its stock to drop 11%.

Aurora stock jumped by over 30% in Tuesday's session after announcing these collaborations, with shares now settling and closing the trading week just slightly higher. Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explains ""Nvidia provides a really critical part of our system"" — the Aurora Driver system that enables the autonomous vehicles — ""the processor that our algorithms run on."" Nvidia's Drive Thor and DriveOS (operating system) will be integrated into the Aurora Driver system. ""If you're a trucking company today, you're limited to driving that vehicle 11 hours a day because people get tired. With what we're building with the Aurora driver, you should be able to operate that vehicle more like 20 hours a day,"" Urmson further elaborates, adding that this will reduce the dangers of stress and sleep deprivation for long-haul commercial truckers. ""The driver won't get tired. So you can run longer at lower speeds, so you have more fuel economy, which is good for the environment and good for the bottom line. And, of course, while driving a truck is a really important job and we should be thankful for anyone who's willing to do it, there aren't enough people who actually want to do it because it's a tough job."" Urmson also discusses with Market Domination's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton the pre-revenue company's competition with other self-driving truck innovators — such as Tesla (TSLA) — and its current customers, such as FedEx (FDX) and Uber Freight (UBER).

2025-04-21 12:00:19,What Trump tariffs really mean to semiconductors: Former Intel CEO,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. There isn’t much Pat Gelsinger hasn’t done in the tech industry. He created cutting-edge technology decades ago at Intel (INTC). Then went off to VMware to reinvent the tech player. He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.

2025-05-12 12:00:37,Why US-China tariff agreement isn’t super bullish for stocks,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The bulls are back on Wall Street, with good reason. The US and China have agreed to ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of meetings in Switzerland, the US will take reciprocal tariffs on China down to 10% from 125%. A separate tariff imposed by President Trump over what he says is China’s role in the fentanyl trade will stay intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. Stocks soared on the news, the US dollar caught a strong bid, and defensive plays such as gold sold off. Investors will now be looking for two things to keep the bullish vibes going: first, that the two economic superpowers signal there is an opportunity to take tariffs down even further after the 90-day pause; and second, that the tariffs aren’t hammering the US economy. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with eToro global markets analyst Lale Akoner on Opening Bid for perspective on whether stocks will be back for the rest of the year or if this is just a headfake.

The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

Charting a path toward domination of the digital universe. Roblox is fresh off a better-than-expected first quarter as it gained traction in new gaming genres such as racing and sports amongst children over the age of 13. Sales, daily active users, and bookings all increased by double-digit percentages. Sales clocked in at $1.03 billion, up 29% from the prior year. Bookings—a measure of in-game currency sales—gained 31% to $1.2 billion. Average daily users improved 26% to 97.8 million. Total hours of engagement on the platform increased 30% to 21.7 billion. Roblox (RBLX) had a really strong Q1, with revenue, bookings, and daily active users all up by double digits compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year, Roblox sees revenue of $4.3 billion to $4.365 billion, up about 19.5% year over year. Adjusted operating profits are forecast between $205 million and $265 million. At the midpoint, it would equate to adjusted operating profit growth of about 28%. The strong start to the year has pushed Roblox shares to a 52-week high. Shares are up 165% over the past year. So what’s next for Roblox? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with Roblox founder and CEO Dave Baszucki. Baszucki shares his plans to simulate reality at scale, improve a fledgling advertising business, and take more market share away from traditional video games. He also pushes back on the notion that Roblox isn’t safe for children. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.
